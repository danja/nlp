# GraphRAG

I reckon there's enormous potential in wiring (bits of) the Web to LLMs. I found an insight into a way of doing that in this [Notebook](https://www.siwei.io/en/demos/graph-rag/) from [Wey Gu](https://siwei.io/en/).

In there he demonstrates and compares augmenting an LLM with different query engines :

- Knowledge Graph
- Graph RAG
- Vector RAG
- Graph Vector RAG

groundwork for applying the same approach to Linked Data and the Web.

that should be doable, hopefully

Graph DB ... SPARQL Store ... Graph DB + SPARQL + Web
These different query engines :

RAG + LLM and Knowledge Graph a

LangChain & LlamaIndex
"LlamaIndex provides a simple interface between LLMs and external data sources, while LangChain provides a framework for building and managing LLM-powered applications."
