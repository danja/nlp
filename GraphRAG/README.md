# GraphRAG

I reckon there's enormous potential in wiring (bits of) the Web to LLMs [[note below](#) about where I was with this]. I found an insight into a way of doing that in this [Notebook](https://www.siwei.io/en/demos/graph-rag/) from [Wey Gu](https://siwei.io/en/).

In there he demonstrates and compares augmenting an LLM with different query engines :

- Knowledge Graph
- Graph RAG
- Vector RAG
- Graph Vector RAG

groundwork for applying the same approach to Linked Data and the Web.

that should be doable, hopefully

### Where was I?

\*Gratuitous bit of bio : I've been fascinated by AI since reading SF books so as a kid, as soon as I got a computer started playing. When I finally got to university I took modules in Neural Networks and Expert Systems. I could see the NN ideas had huge potential, but with the hardware (& algorithms) of the time it wasn't feasible to do much. So I leaned towards the Expert Systems side - essentially using logic reasoners to solve problems. Soon after, this was just as the
