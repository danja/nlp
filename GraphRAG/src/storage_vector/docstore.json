film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team Guardians of the Galaxy, produced by Marvel Studios, and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), and the 32nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by James Gunn, it features an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Will Poulter, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Linda Cardellini, Nathan Fillion, and Sylvester Stallone. In the film, the Guardians embark on a mission to protect Rocket (Cooper) from the High Evolutionary (Iwuji).\nGunn stated in November 2014 that he had initial ideas for a third and final film in the series, and announced his return to write and direct in April 2017. Disney fired him from the film in July 2018 following the resurfacing of controversial posts on Twitter, but the studio reversed course by that October and reinstated him. Gunn's return was publicly revealed in March 2019, with production resuming after he completed work for DC on The Suicide Squad (2021) and the first season of its spin-off series Peacemaker (2022). Filming began in November 2021 at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and lasted until May 2022.\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 5, as part of Phase Five of the MCU. Like its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $845 million worldwide, and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt their new headquarters on Knowhere, the Guardians of the Galaxy are attacked by Adam, a Sovereign warrior created by their high priestess Ayesha, who seeks to destroy the Guardians for stealing from her.After Adam critically wounds Rocket, he is stabbed by Nebula and flees.The Guardians cannot heal Rocket's wounds with their med-packs due to a kill switch embedded in him by Orgocorp, a company helmed by a mad

headquarters to find the switch's override code and save Rocket's life.As Rocket lies unconscious, he recalls his past.As a baby raccoon, he was experimented on by the High Evolutionary, who sought to enhance and anthropomorphize animal lifeforms to create an ideal society called Counter-Earth.Rocket befriended his fellow Batch 89 test subjects: the otter Lylla, the walrus Teefs, and the rabbit Floor.The High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket's rapidly growing intelligence but became furious once it exceeded his own.The High Evolutionary used Rocket to perfect his Animen creations, then planned to harvest Rocket's brain for further research and exterminate the obsolete Batch 89.Rocket freed his friends, but the High Evolutionary killed Lylla.Enraged, Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary, but his henchmen killed Teefs and Floor during a firefight with Rocket, before the latter fled Counter-Earth in a spaceship.In the present, the Ravagers, including an alternate version of Gamora, help the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp.They retrieve Rocket's file but discover that the code was removed, with the likely culprit being Theel, one of the High Evolutionary's advisors.The Guardians, along with Gamora, depart for Counter-Earth to find him.They are followed by Ayesha and Adam after the High Evolutionary, their race's creator, threatened to wipe out the Sovereign if they fail to retrieve Rocket.The Guardians reach Counter-Earth and are guided to the Ar\u00eate Laboratories complex.Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket as Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula travel

depression\" following the appearance of a variant of his dead lover Gamora, who does not share the same affection for Quill as her older version had for him, which in turn affects his leadership of the Guardians.Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora:An orphan who seeks redemption for her past crimes, and was adopted and trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin.The original version of Gamora, a member of the Guardians, was killed by Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and an alternate version of the character traveled to the present in Avengers: Endgame (2019); Salda\u00f1a reprises the latter role in this film, now serving as a member of the Ravagers.Salda\u00f1a stated that Vol.3 would be the final time she would portray Gamora, noting that she originally signed to play her in one film and ended up playing the role for much longer, a role she was grateful to play due to the impact it especially had on female fans.Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer:A member of the Guardians and a highly skilled warrior whose family was slaughtered by Ronan the Accuser, under the instructions of Thanos.Bautista stated that Vol.3 would be the final time he would portray Drax, having been grateful for the role, while still calling it a \"relief\" to have concluded his time with the character, given the long hours needed to get into makeup and hoping to pursue more dramatic acting roles.Because of Bautista's decision, Gunn opted not to include Drax in the post-credits scene.Karen Gillan as Nebula:A member of the Guardians, a former Avenger, and Gamora's adoptive sister who, similarly to her, was trained by their adoptive father Thanos to be his personal assassin.Gillan believed Nebula was developing into a \"slightly different person\" with more levity as she starts to heal psychologically following the death of Thanos, who was the source of her abuse and torment.Vol.3 fulfills a character arc for the character writer and director James Gunn envisioned when starting work on Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), going from a minor villain to a member of the Guardians.Although the film teases a possible romance between Star-Lord and Nebula, Gunn denies having ever considered the two becoming a couple, though Gillan does believe she harbors a small crush on Quill.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

calling him \"a detestable character\".When asked by Rachel Lindsay of Extra about the character, Gunn referred to the High Evolutionary as the \"cruelest MCU villain\" to date the franchise has ever

Galaxy (2014) writer and director James Gunn stated in November 2014 that, in addition to having the \"basic story\" for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 (2017) while working on the first film, he also had ideas for a potential third film.Despite this, he was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third Guardians film, saying that it would depend on how he felt after making Vol.2.In April 2016, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, the producer of the Guardians films, said a third film was planned for the franchise as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in \"2020 and beyond\".In March 2017, Gunn said there would be a third film \"for sure.We're trying to figure it out\", soon adding that there were no specific plans for the film yet, but that Marvel would want to make it \"unless something goes horribly\u2014which is always possible, you never know\".He also reiterated that he had not decided whether he would be directing the film, and that he was going to figure out his involvement and his next project \"over the next couple of weeks\".Part of Gunn's reluctance to return to the franchise came from not wanting to work on it without Michael Rooker, whose character from the first two films, Yondu Udonta, died at the end of Vol.2.Gunn announced in April 2017 that he would return to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3.He said the film would be set after Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), and would \"conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond\".He also felt that the three Guardians films would \"work together as a whole\", telling one story, with the third film \"tying a lot of stuff together\" from the first two and giving \"a lot of answers on a lot of different things\".Gunn also planned to work with Marvel on the future of the \"Marvel Cosmic Universe\".He was set to begin work on Vol.3 shortly after completing his work as executive producer and consultant on Infinity War.On returning for the third film, Gunn said, \"I wouldn't have said yes if I didn't have a fairly clear idea of where we were going and what we were going to do.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

don't have a vision for it\".After originally including Adam Warlock in his script treatment for Vol.2, Gunn and Feige noted the importance of the character on the cosmic side of the MCU and hinted that he would make an appearance in Vol.3.In May 2017, after the release of Vol.2, Gunn said he would be creating the third film \"over the next three years\", and confirmed that Pom Klementieff would reprise her role as Mantis.He also intended to have Elizabeth Debicki reprise her role as Ayesha.By mid-June, Gunn had completed the first draft of his script treatment for the third film, and was considering changing a piece of character info he had placed in the background of the mugshot sequence in the first film (when the Guardians are captured by the Nova Corps).In September, Gunn reiterated that Vol.3 would be released \"in a little under three years\", as the film had privately been set for release on May 1, 2020.At the end of February 2018, Gunn planned to meet with Mark Hamill about possibly appearing in the film.In April, Chris Pratt was set to reprise his role as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the following month, Dave Bautista confirmed that he would reprise his role as Drax the Destroyer.Marvel received the completed first draft of the screenplay from Gunn by the end of June, ahead of the beginning of official pre-production on the film.\n\n\n==== Firing of James Gunn ====\nOn July 20, 2018, Disney and Marvel severed ties with Gunn.This came after conservative commentators, such as Mike Cernovich, began circulating old tweets he had made regarding controversial topics such as rape and pedophilia, and called for his firing.The Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn stated, \"The offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James' Twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio's values, and we have severed our business relationship with him\".While not part of the decision to fire Gunn, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger supported the \"unanimous decision\" from the various executives at Marvel and Walt Disney Studios.In response, Gunn said in a series of tweets that when he started his career he was \"making movies and telling jokes that were outrageous and taboo\" but felt as he has \"developed as a person, so has my work and my humor\".", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"},

but I am very, very different than I was a few years ago; today I try to root my work in love and connection and less in anger.My days saying something just because it's shocking and trying to get a reaction are over\".In a separate statement, Gunn said the tweets at the time were \"totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative\", adding \"I understand and accept the business decisions taken today.Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then\".In response to the firing, many of the Guardians cast members tweeted support for Gunn.Rooker decided to leave Twitter, while fans signed an online petition asking for Gunn to be reinstated which received over 300,000 signatures.The firing also garnered reaction from other Hollywood personalities, such as actress Selma Blair and comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, and inspired opinion pieces on the firing and how it would affect Hollywood from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and news organizations such as The Hollywood Reporter, Variety, Deadline Hollywood, and Forbes.On July 30, the cast of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, including Pratt, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Sean Gunn, Klementieff, Rooker, and Karen Gillan, issued a statement in support of James Gunn, saying, \"We fully support James Gunn.We were all shocked by his abrupt firing last week and have intentionally waited these ten days to respond in order to think, pray, listen, and discuss.In that time, we've been encouraged by the outpouring of support from fans and members of the media who wish to see James reinstated as director of Volume 3 as well as discouraged by those so easily duped into believing the many outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding him\".Despite this and the notable \"vociferous support\" Gunn received, Variety reported that Disney was not planning to rehire him as the jokes were \"unacceptable in the #MeToo era and are not in line with Disney's family-friendly image\".Variety continued that, despite rumors of Gunn being replaced by established Marvel directors such as Jon Favreau, Taika Waititi, or the Russo brothers, Marvel had yet to meet with any other director, and would most likely hire someone new.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

fulfill his contract and appear in the film as long as Marvel chose to use Gunn's existing script.Disney and Marvel still wanted to \"move forward quickly\" on the film, and were soon confirmed to be keeping Gunn's script.This, combined with the fact that Gunn did not breach his contract since the tweets were written years before he signed on to the film, had led to \"complicated negotiations\" between Gunn and Disney over his exit settlement.Gunn was expected to be paid $7\u201310 million or more, and there was some hope that the negotiations could lead to him eventually returning in some capacity, \"even if [it was] to develop and direct another Marvel movie\".Gunn would be free to move on to new projects following the settlement, and other major studios were interested in hiring him including Warner Bros. for their rival superhero franchise, the DC Extended Universe (DCEU).During this time, executives at Marvel Studios began \"back channel conversations\" with Disney in an attempt to find a compromise that could lead to Gunn returning to the film in some way.This \"eleventh-hour\" effort from Marvel was inspired by the statements from the film's cast.In mid-August, Gunn met with Horn following a strong push from Gunn's talent agency for him to be given a second chance.Despite this and the reported \"civil and professional\" nature of the meeting, Horn only took it as a courtesy and used it to reaffirm Disney's decision to fire Gunn.Later in August, the small crew that was preparing for pre-production were dismissed as production of the film was postponed so Marvel and Disney could find a director to replace Gunn.Pre-production was to have begun by the end of 2018, with principal photography set for January or February 2019.At this time, Bautista was unsure if he would return for the film, as he did not know if he would \"want to work for Disney\" given how they handled the firing of Gunn.In late September, James Gunn's brother Sean, who played Kraglin Obfonteri and provided motion capture for Rocket in the previous Guardians films, reiterated that Disney still intended on making the film with James's script, but had not revealed to the cast when production may continue.Sean added that he had been preparing to reprise his roles for the third film before his brother's firing.At the end of the month, Cooper was asked if he would consider

discussed his commitments to The Suicide Squad with Feige, and production on Vol.3 was put on hold until February 2021 to allow Gunn to complete The Suicide Squad first.In December, after working with Marvel Studios on the script for Ant-Man (2015), Adam McKay said he was willing to work with the studio again and stated that he had discussed taking over as director for Vol.3 with Feige, among other projects.In early 2019, Feige and Pratt reiterated that Marvel would still make Vol.3, and in March 2019, Gunn was publicly revealed to have been rehired as director of the film.Deadline Hollywood stated that Marvel Studios had \"never met with or considered any other director\" for the film.By the end of April, the franchise's five main stars\u2014Pratt, Salda\u00f1a, Bautista, Cooper, and Diesel\u2014were all expected to return for the sequel, with filming to take place in 2020.Discussing his firing and re-hiring in May 2019, Gunn said that of all the elements of the film that he had been sad to leave when he was fired, the most meaningful to him was the character of Rocket.Gunn personally identifies with Rocket, describing himself and the character as \"the same\".He had actually grown to love the character since working on the first film due to feeling that an origin story for Rocket could justify what a Bugs Bunny-like \"goofy character\" like him could exist in the MCU if it were the saddest one in the universe, crediting it as the \"seed\" of the trilogy.While Vol.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

through flashbacks akin to those from the story structure of The Godfather Part II (1974), Gunn initially considered to tell Rocket's origins in a team-up movie between him and Groot without the other Guardians, but ultimately felt that he had to conclude Peter Quill's story first and then focus on Rocket in a third Guardians-centric film.That month, Gillan confirmed that she was returning for the sequel and expressed excitement for Gunn's return to the franchise.In June, Salda\u00f1a was asked about her role in the film after her character Gamora was killed in Infinity War, and she returned to play a younger version in Endgame who travels through time to the present.Salda\u00f1a said that Gamora's fate would depend on the plans that Marvel and Gunn have for Vol.3, but that she would like to see Gamora rejoin the Guardians and also be portrayed as \"the most lethal woman in the galaxy\" as she has been referred to previously.Gunn was asked in October if he was unhappy about Marvel's decision to kill Gamora in Infinity War and said he was not, adding that he had discussed the storyline with the studio beforehand.According to Infinity War and Endgame screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Gamora was brought back in Endgame specifically so that Gunn could include her in Vol.3, so Gunn found no complications over writing her character arc in Vol.3 due to having been told in advance.In December, Gunn was asked if he would have Yondu return in the film and said as long as he was involved with the Guardians characters, he would not have the character be resurrected.Gunn felt the stakes of a character's death were important and said characters who die in his films would likely remain dead.Gunn said in February 2020 that bringing Yondu back to life would \"nullify Yondu's sacrifice\" in Vol.2, and said the character would not return unless it was for a prequel or flashback; Gunn later said Yondu would not be resurrected in the film to not diminish his death's meaning.In April, Gunn said the COVID-19 pandemic would not affect production plans for the film at that time, saying the next month that the film would be released \"a little after 2021\".In August 2020, Gunn turned in a new draft of the film's script and began writing a spin-off television series from The Suicide Squad titled Peacemaker (2022).", "start_char_idx": null,

November that the script for Vol.3 was finished, and said that very little had changed from his initial ideas despite the production setbacks.The film was given a 2023 release date a month later, with

this ending was decided upon \"in editing\" and conflicted with his already-submitted screenplay for Vol.3, since he never planned to feature Thor in the film.Gunn had begun storyboarding the film by June, with filming later revealed to begin in November 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia for an expected end around April 2022.By then, Bautista said he had not read a script for Vol.3 and was unsure if it had changed during the production delays.The next month, Gillan said that she and Klementieff had read the script together and she found it to be incredible, brilliant, emotional and funny.She also felt it was Gunn's \"strongest work yet\" with the Guardians characters.Gunn reiterated that the script had \"basically stayed the same\" from three years prior but he had been \"playing with it in little ways\" over the years.He was in the middle of another draft by the end of the month and said the film would be emotional and have a \"heavier\" story than the previous films, with a more grounded approach that was inspired by The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker.An early option Gunn had in mind for the character who would become the film's main villain and be revealed to be the one who created Rocket was the Fantastic Four villain Annihilus, but Gunn ultimately opted to fill that role with the High Evolutionary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

cast as Kingo in Marvel Studios' Eternals (2021).By late August, Gunn and Marvel Studios began meeting with actors for the role of Adam Warlock, including Will Poulter.George MacKay was also on the shortlist and Reg\u00e9-Jean Page was considered for the part.Poulter auditioned for the role over Zoom before an in-person screen test with Gunn in Atlanta.When first auditioning for Warlock, Poulter was unaware of who his character's name was other than he had been teased at the post-credits scene of Vol.2, but Marvel just described the role to him as \"an untitled character\" until Poulter was \"drip-fed\" with more information over and over until discovering how steeped Adam Warlock is in the source material.In September, Gillan reiterated her positive comments about the script and said the film would explore the characters from the previous Guardians films on a deeper level, while Seth Green, who voices Howard the Duck in the MCU, said the film would be about Gamora and Nebula's story.He did not know at that time if Howard would appear after doing so in the previous Guardians films.Poulter was cast as Adam Warlock in October, and Gunn said \"dozens of roles\" had already been cast.Poulter was chosen for the part because of his dramatic and comedic abilities and because Gunn \"wanted somebody who was youthful\" and would fit with Marvel Studios' future plans for the character.Casting also took place for various background roles, including aliens and security guards.Pratt began rehearsals and camera tests later that month, and a production meeting was held in early November, shortly before the start of filming.Gunn also reiterated his comments on not resurrecting Yondu in the film.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began on November 8, 2021, at

photo of the main cast members which revealed that Chukwudi Iwuji was part of the film following his collaboration with Gunn on Peacemaker.Iwuji's screen test for the film was shot on the set of Peacemaker with that series' crew, and Marvel repaid this favor by letting Gunn use the Vol.3 set and crew to film Ezra Miller's cameo appearance as Barry Allen / The Flash for the Peacemaker season finale.Production designer Beth Mickle said Gunn chose to mainly use practical effects for Vol.3 after they did so with their work on The Suicide Squad.In February 2021, Gunn stated the film would be shot using Industrial Light & Magic's StageCraft virtual production technology that was developed for the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian, but in October, he said they would not be able to use the technology because the sets were too big, believing they were larger than the sets used on The Suicide Squad.The interior of the Guardians' new ship, the Bowie, was a four-story set.Judianna

actors as well, and called the Holiday Special shoot easier than Vol.3.In February 2022, Callie Brand was revealed to appear in the film as an alien.Shooting was also expected to occur in London, England, in late 2021.Vol.3 is the first MCU film to feature the word \"fuck\" uncensored; it is spoken by Quill.The dialogue was not scripted, but improvised by Pratt on Gunn's suggestion, though

The next month, he added that he was \"panicking\" about the soundtrack and had to make some \"pretty specific choices\" shortly due to the wider range of available music for the story, By early July 2017, Gunn had narrowed down his choices for potential songs to 181, but noted that this list could grow again. All of the songs for the film had been selected by the following month; the songs are not modern and come from Quill's Zune that he received at the end of Vol. 2, although Gunn added that the soundtrack was not limited to 1970s pop songs compared to the first two films, instead spanning multiple decades. Gunn was unable to use the song \"Russian Roulette\" by the Lords of the New Church for Vol. 3 due to a legal battle over its ownership. The film opens with an acoustic version of \"Creep\" by Radiohead, which provided \"a much different tone from the beginning than the other two films\". The film ends with \"Dog Days Are Over\" by Florence and the Machine, as Gunn is a fan of its album Lungs; he had thought about including the song to wrap-up the trilogy since he started writing Vol. 2.The track list for Awesome Mix Vol. 3 was revealed in April 2023, and was made available on Spotify and Apple Music on April 3 as part of a larger Guardians of the Galaxy: The Official Mixtape playlist, which also featured the soundtracks and scores from the previous two films. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 was released by Hollywood Records on CD and digital download on May 3, 2023, a 12\" 2-LP vinyl on May 5, and is set to release on cassette on July 7.In October 2021, Gunn revealed that John Murphy was composing the film's score and had already recorded music to be played on set during filming.

years\" as did Vox and the CBC.In mixed reviews, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian and Nicholas Barber of the BBC agreed the film was overlong, Barber opining that \"the film's saving grace is that, just as Gunn has been allowed to unleash his gonzo imagination, he has also been allowed to pour out his emotions.\"Wendy Ide of The Observer lauded the films for its emotional weight and deemed it a satisfying conclusion, stating that \"What elevates Vol 3 (supposedly the final film in the GOTG series) is the way it keeps that personality, nodding to the irreverent swagger that is a crucial component of the Guardians USP while delivering a series of devastating emotional sucker punches along the way.\"Matt Singer from ScreenCrush praised the film for concluding Rocket's arc story stating that \"a character tells Rocket that the events unfolding onscreen have been his story all along \u2014 and with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3, it does feel like Marvel has spent $200 million on a

Later in September, Gunn said he was unlikely to return for another Guardians film but would continue to work with Marvel Studios on other projects that use the Guardians and cosmic characters. One such project from Gunn was a film centered on Drax and Mantis, which Bautista called \"brilliant\". However, in May 2021, Bautista stated that he had not heard any further updates regarding it, feeling Marvel Studios was not \"very interested, or it doesn't fit into the way they have things mapped out\". Gunn confirmed in September 2019 that he intended for Vol. 3 to be his last Guardians film, which he reaffirmed in May 2021. In July 2021, Gillan expressed her desire to continue playing Nebula after Vol. 3. In April 2023, Salda\u00f1a confirmed that Vol. 3 would be the last time she portrays Gamora, but hoped Marvel would recast the role with a younger actor because she wished for the character to continue. The following month, Pratt indicated his willingness to continue playing Peter Quill in the future if the right script came along, and a note at the end of Vol. 3's post-credits scene states that the \"Legendary Star-Lord\" would return to the MCU.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website  at Marvel.com\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 at IMDb", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"1afb1ad2-82eb-404b-a45f-ada57fb00b7b": {"node_ids": ["616871ed-fcef-4e34-b1b9-6beaca446179", "53aa9c41-f184-49ad-a719-4db8f278c977", "f6259ea1-4f01-4171-b05d-3da658a3adcd", "2b488f98-18dc-436b-ad85-1d35e7c34d18", "78a9565f-bbe8-4f38-9511-40305a47bbe9", "71ea9898-dec8-42e3-8771-686337d4dd34", "22725d2d-d256-4fd3-a675-3c0229d5b4ba", "a694b9ae-56f1-486c-89ff-ee094c027344", "c976c9e0-6acc-4bed-81fe-b7f2ad38b9ff", "a741777c-52a5-4159-adff-4fb00f44ca3a", "60650ccf-e3f9-4508-b91e-8f55746b3ef8", "54335362-43da-45c8-8d77-5a7c247e19d0", "3bcc8f2c-6825-41b0-b5fa-da1e68d38665", "1914211a-1082-408f-981e-8fedb2d3ab05", "3323baa2-01e6-4281-a5d7-7965ce92a556", "9209014f-4917-4e74-be67-4a3eb35afe17", "b229a69b-1e33-48d6-ad28-1e3a3d239236", "33184e41-0474-4538-aa3d-01763af8b702", "a4a09131-76f4-4c61-a66f-a6cae716bd22", "94fd710d-ae91-4883-b06a-bf9cec8ad173", "6913b3e5-4f09-46e3-9bd6-c728d4df21e2", "8568a70c-39de-4403-854c-7d8299b5378b", "ac95fd17-eb2b-4d15-ab86-18c9181cd19d", "2ee5880d-5efc-4493-a679-0384a5389c3f"], "metadata": {}}}}
