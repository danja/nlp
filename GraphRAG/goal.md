# SPARQL for LlamaIndex : The Goal

**TL;DR** : allow LLM-based systems to use information from the Web in a structured and efficent fashion.

## The Problem

## A Possible Solution

### LlamaIndex

> LlamaIndex is a data framework for LLM applications to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data.

It includes :

- Data connectors
- Data indexes
- Engines provide natural language access to data
- Query engines
- Chat engines
- Data agents
- Application integrations

existing graph connectors, Graph RAG

### SPARQL

The [SPARQL Query Language for RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) is part of a raft of [W3C Recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/). It provides a means of interacting with RDF data.

#### RDF

The [Resource Description Framework](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) provides a means of representing data that is inherently, by design, interoperable with the World Wide Web. Key to this is the use of URIs (especially URLs) to identify conceptual resouces and relations between them. It uses a graph model, which may be expressed as a series of _subject-property-object_ triples. (Typically _subject_ and _property_ are URI-identified resources, _object_ may be the same or a string literal). There are several different format specifications ([Turtle](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-turtle-20140225/) is the most human-readable). The RDF model is descriptive rather prescriptive, it doesn't have schemas in the traditional DB sense, though RDF Schemas provide a means of disambiguating descriptions. The formal semantics of RDF+RDFS are relatively lightweight, though additional inference can be layered on top, notably by [OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/), the Web Ontology language.

#### SPARQL Stores

SPARQL Stores act as graph databases, storing RDF as URI-named graphs. The SPARQL language uses queries comparable to other query languages (SELECT, INSERT etc).
The standard protocols are built on HTTP (GET, POST, PUT etc). There are numerous [store implementations](https://github.com/RDFLib/sparqlwrapper#sparql-endpoint-implementations), client tools & libraries.
