### SPARQL

The [SPARQL Query Language for RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) is part of a raft of [W3C Recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/). It provides a means of interacting with RDF data.

#### RDF

The [Resource Description Framework](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) provides a means of representing data that is inherently, by design, interoperable with the World Wide Web.
