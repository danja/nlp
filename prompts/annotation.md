I will upload a zip file. The task is to add type annotations to sparql.py, in the style of nebulagraph.py. I have included typing-cheat-sheet.html for reference.

The SparqlGraphStore class implements the GraphStore protocol defined in the types.py file. This class serves as a graph store for storing and retrieving knowledge graph data using a SPARQL endpoint. It contains various methods to interact with the SPARQL database, including methods to create graphs, insert data, and query data using SPARQL queries.

The class utilizes the SPARQLWrapper library to facilitate the communication with the SPARQL endpoint. It also contains utility methods for generating random IDs and for escaping and unescaping strings for RDF/SPARQL queries.


* create_graph
The create_graph function takes a URI as a parameter and creates a new graph with that URI in the SPARQL database by calling the sparql_update method with a SPARQL query string that contains the CREATE GRAPH command.

Sure, here are concise descriptions for each of the remaining functions in the `sparql.py` file:

2. **sparql_query**
   - Takes a SPARQL query string as a parameter, executes the query, and returns the results as a list of dictionaries. It handles errors gracefully, logging them and returning an empty list in case of an exception.

3. **sparql_update**
   - Takes a SPARQL update query string as a parameter, executes the update query, and logs the message returned by the endpoint. It does not return any value.

4. **insert_data**
   - Takes a data string representing RDF triplets in SPARQL syntax, constructs a SPARQL INSERT DATA query by appending the data string to a predefined prefix and graph URI, and then executes the query using the `sparql_update` method. It does not return any value.

5. **make_id**
   - Generates and returns a random 4-character ID consisting of uppercase letters and digits.

6. **escape_for_rdf**
   - Takes a string as input, escapes control characters and quotes to make it safe for inclusion in RDF/SPARQL queries, and returns the escaped string.

7. **unescape_from_rdf**
   - Takes a string as input, unescapes quotes and SPARQL's unicode escape sequences, and returns the unescaped string.

8. **select_triplets**
   - Takes a subject string and a limit as parameters, constructs and executes a SPARQL SELECT query to get triplets related to the subject from the database, and returns the results as a list of dictionaries.

9. **rels**
   - Similar to `select_triplets`, but with a different SPARQL query to get relations (rels) for the given subject. Returns the results as a list of dictionaries.

10. **to_arrows**
    - Takes a subject string and a list of relations as parameters, transforms the relations into a format suitable for the Arrows tool, and returns the transformed relations as a list of dictionaries.

Each description is quite concise, summarizing the core functionality of each function. Let me know if you'd like more details or if this is satisfactory.
