I would now like to write a test file. I will upload a zip file and then describe its contents.

In the zip `test_simple_docstore.py` is a test for `simple_docstore.py`. `types-docstore.py` is an interface for `simple_docstore.py`. I want to create `test_simple_graph_store.py` to test `simple_graph_store.py` following the general pattern of `test_simple_docstore.py`. `types-graph_store.py` is an interface for `simple_graph_store.py`. Can you first provide me with a skeleton of `test_simple_graph_store.py`, and then step through the functions of `simple_graph_store.py` one at a time, providing me with a test for each to go into the skeleton.

The file to be tested will ultimately be be `llama_index/graph_stores/simple.py` and the test
`tests/graph_stores/test_simple_graph_store.py`. Could you please adjust the skeleton as necessary to reflect these paths.
